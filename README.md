# CHIP-8 Emulator

> A simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C using SDL2.

## Spec

- All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first.
- 4K RAM (`0x0 ~ 0xfff`)
  - `0x0 ~ 0x1ff`: reserverd for system
  - `0x200 ~ 0xe9f`: freely used RAM
  - `0xea0 ~ 0xeff`: reserved for stack, internal use and other variables
  - `0xf00 ~ 0xfff`: for display
- 64x32 resolution display (1 bit per pixel)
- Font sprite starts at `0x000`, see details below
- 8-bit delay and sound timer
- 16 8-bit registers `V0` ~ `VF`
- A 16-bit program counter (`PC`)
- A 8-bit stack pointer (`SP`)
- One 16-bit address register `I`
- Instruction set
  - `8XYE`: `VF` should be the most significant bit of `VX` not `VY` prior to the shift
  - `8XY6`: Same as above
  - `FX55`: Don't increset `I`
  - `FX65`: Same as above

## Keymapping

```text
1 2 3 C        1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D   ->   Q W E R
7 8 9 E        A S D F
A 0 B F        Z X C V
```

## Build

Linux:

- install SDL2: `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
- Git clone the repo
- `make linux && make test`

Mac OS:
- Install SDL2: `brew install sdl2`
- Git clone the repo
- `make mac && make test`

Windows:

- Download MSYS2 64bit from here: https://www.msys2.org/
- Update MSYS2: `pacman -Syu`
- Install build tools and SDL2: `pacman -S make git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2`
- Start MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit Shell
- Git clone the repo
- `make windows && make test`

## Test

There are a few roms in the `rom` directory of repo.

`BC_Test.ch8` and `test_opcode.ch8` are used for testing the fundamental functions of our emulator.

`test.ch8` is used for testing arbitrary instructions written by ourself.

All others are games for fully testing our emulator ðŸŽ®.

## Usage

`Usage: chip8 <rom> <scale>`

eg:

```bash
./bin/chip8 rom/TEST 5
```

```bash
./bin/chip8 rom/IBM 10
```

fullscreen
```bash
./bin/chip8 rom/TEST 0
```
